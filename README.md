# Vintage Story Primitive Survival Patch

A small patch mod that disables the Pelts in Primitive Survival.

Without this you're able to place pelts of any animal by repeatedly destroying and placing them, allowing you to have the pelt of any animal in the game - even if you haven't slain that particular animal.
